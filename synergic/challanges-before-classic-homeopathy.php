                                    <ol>
                                        <li>A homeopath is supposed to find out remedy based on subjective symptoms described mostly by patients who are unable to observe or describe their symptoms correctly.</li>
                                        <li>Based on often inadequate and incomplete symptoms a homeopath is supposed to prescribe a single remedy based on principle of similimum. Should a patient be examined separately by different homeopaths, hardly they will agree to the same similimum.</li>
                                        <li>A patient over 50 years of age normally suffers from so many chronic diseases having diverse group of symptoms which cannot be covered by a single remedy.</li>

                                        <li>Case taking under classic homeopathy for finding a single similimum normally takes about 2 hours. This means that a classic homeopath can hardly take 4- 5 cases per day. For this he will have to charge a very high consultation fee for his maintenance in contrast to other homeopaths cheaply available in the market.</li>

                                        <li>A patient normally comes to a homeopath with clear cut diagnosis of a disease, but homeopathy has no specific remedy for any disease. Lack of standardized treatment of diseases makes homeopathy more subjective than scientific.</li>

                                        <li>In its present form homeopathy is attracting less number of patients due to long hours of questioning. Even after spending so much time in taking a case, the medicines suggested by various homeopaths for a patient do not behave as a similimum for that particular case. Hence due to lack of standardized treatment it is denied by main stream practitioners and the scientific community.</li>

                                        <li>For the above reason homeopathy is becoming less attractive and lucrative as a profession and many homeopaths are having to supplement their income by having an alternate career, such as teaching in schools, being insurance agents, etc. A survey in June 2004 by Dr. Sushil Vats in Delhi revealed an alarmingly grim picture of the homeopathic practice. Out of the total of 3500 homeopaths in the city area, only 50% are into active practice and of these 50% have another source of income and of the remaining, only 10% have income worthy to survive in metros like Delhi.</li>

                                        <li>The curriculum of study in homeopathic colleges and universities are teaching more philosophy and less practical application. The result is that most of them fail at the practice front.</li>

                                        <li>Many homeopaths have given up prescribing single remedy for success in their practice, but feel shy of sharing this in Seminars. As a result of this most of the homeopaths are suffering from guilt and self-imposed hypocrisy.</li>

                                        <li>On many occasions biochemic remedies and mother tinctures are of great help in curing the patients. Their use goes against the principle of similimum. A homeopath is confused how to recover from this dilemma.</li>
