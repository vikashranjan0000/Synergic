                                            Hahnemann, who discovered Homeopathy, was a genius and an intellectual giant drawing parallel only to Newton who discovered Law of Gravitation. It is said that once Newton went to a blacksmith and asked him to make a cage with two doors, one for the bigger cat and another for a smaller cat. The blacksmith convinced him that one big door is enough for both the cats. Similarly contention of Hahnemann that no one knows how two medicines will act together seems to be an intellectual blunder. It is similar to arguing that rice will provide carbohydrate, pulse will provide protein, vegetables will provide vitamins, but no one knows what they will provide if taken together. It requires only a common sense to conclude that by taking these substances together all the ingredients will be available to the consumer. Similarly when we give more than one medicine to the patient, all the medicines will work synergistically on the patient.</p>

                                            Multiple drug therapy in Synergic Homeopathy can be explained easily by immunization against multiple diseases. For immunization of new born or infant at the time of birth, it is recommended to vaccinate against three diseases at a time. Polio, Hepatitis B and tuberculosis(BCG).Again Panta vac, Hexavac vaccines are single injections for five disease, Diphtheria, Tetanus pertussis, Hepatitis -B and Influenza - B. This means five vaccines are combined or 5 Antigen for different diseases have been combined in same solution or same base. Now result is that they increase power of each other. They do not decrease power of each other. They increase body immunity and vital energy at the same time.

                                            Prescribing group of medicines or symilimums based on group of diseases and symptoms present in a patient is known as Synergic Homeopathy.
                                            Selection of single Similimum for treating a patient is almost an impossible task firstly because of incompleteness of symptoms available and secondly because a patient often comes to a Homeopath with multiple diseases having diverse group of symptoms not covered by a single medicine. For example if a patient comes to a doctor with diabetes, heart failure and prostate enlargement, can anyone find a single similimum for all his ailments? On the other hand finding a group of Similimums/ medicines covering all the ailments or symptoms of the patient is not a difficult job.
